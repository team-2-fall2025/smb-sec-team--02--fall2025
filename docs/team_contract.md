title: Team Contract --- Group
---

# 1) Roles

We have 4 members. Two are for the backend development, two are for the
frontend. For the other work, the team leader can assign tasks to other
team members to ensure that the workload is distributed fairly among all
members.

# 2) Meeting Cadence

-   In-person communication: the team meeting will be held after the
    class, and every team member needs to share their thoughts and
    progress.

-   Online communication: Discord: #meeting-notes (record the meeting
    notes), #general (for discussion).

# 3) Decision Rules

-   Quorum: 3/4 present (live or async votes within 24h).

-   Normal decisions: Simple majority.

-   Ties / blocked: Team Lead decides after hearing 1 pro & 1 con.

-   High-impact (scope, deadlines, infra): require quorum + TL sign-off;
    document decisions.

# 4) Code of Conduct

-   Respect & inclusion: One speaker at a time; assume good intent.

-   Transparent work: Keep issues small; status in Discord.

-   Review kindness: Critique code, not people; propose concrete fixes.

-   Security first: No secrets in Git; rotate any accidental leaks and
    remove immediately.

-   Academic integrity: Attribute sources/snippets; no plagiarism.

# 5) Escalation Path (Incidents & Blockers)

-   Severity guide:

-   \- Sev-1 (prod outage/secret leak): Stop work → notify \@team →
    rotate/contain → TL coordinates fix. Acknowledge ≤15 min, status
    every 60 min.

-   \- Sev-2 (build red/merge-blocking): Fix or revert within 4h; pair
    as needed.

-   \- Sev-3 (individual blocker): Ask in #help; if no response in 12h,
    TL assigns help.

-   Escalation ladder: Assignee → Backup owner → Team Lead → Instructor
    (with brief & ask).

-   Post-incident note: 5-line summary, cause, fix, follow-ups in
    /docs/notes/incidents/.
